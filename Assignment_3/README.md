**P1:**   Firstly, I collected 25 observations randomly from the larger population. Then, I calculated the mean and maximum glucose readings for both the sample and the entire population. Afterward, I created bar plots to visually represent the distinct glucose data between the sample and the population based on these calculated values.
**P2:**   I've developed a function to compute the 98th percentile BMI values for both the sample and the entire population. Subsequently, I represented these outcomes on a bar chart displaying the BMI values specifically at the 98th percentile for both the sample and the population.
 **P3**  To determine the average, standard deviation, and percentile for BloodPressure, we generated 500 samples from the population. Each sample contained 150 observations, using bootstrap sampling with replacement. The computed values were illustrated on corresponding bar plots. The statistical metrics—such as the 95th percentile, mean, and standard deviation—derived from the 'BloodPressure' variable in the bootstrap samples closely resemble those of the population. This similarity indicates that the bootstrap samples accurately represent the population for BloodPressure, and the sample statistics provide reliable estimations of the population statistics. It's important to note that these findings are specific to this dataset and might not be universally applicable to other datasets or populations. Therefore, it's crucial to interpret these results with consideration for the unique context in which the data were collected.
